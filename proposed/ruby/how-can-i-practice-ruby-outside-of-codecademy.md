title: How can I practice Ruby outside of Codecademy?
---
Practice to refine your skills. Here's how you can do that outside of Codecademy with Ruby.

**To practice Ruby**, you can either use [Codecademy Labs](http://codecademy.com/labs/) or you can use the official **Ruby Interpreter**. The instructions for installing the Ruby Interpreter follow:

**Windows**: On Windows, you can use the *RubyInstaller* to install Ruby onto your computer. To do this, just visit [www.rubyinstaller.org](http://rubyinstaller.org/) and click "**Download**".

**Mac**: On Mac, you can [install from the source](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (not recommended) or use **Homebrew**. To use Homebrew to install Ruby, open your terminal and enter the following: `brew install ruby`. That's it! You're done.

**Linux**: On Linux, as aforementioned, you can [install from source](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or use your operating system's package manager/terminal. The command to install on linux varies, so we can't provide an accurate tutorial, our apologies!
